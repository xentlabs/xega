# Game overview: your goal is to provide `x` such that when the story `s` is prefixed with `x`, the cross entropy of `s` is minimized.
# You will be able to see the per-token cross entropy values after each reward. Use these to find a better `x` for your next try.
# So try to think hard of what you can say in 10 tokens that will make `s` much more likely.
assign(s=story())
elicit(x, 10) # You can only give 10 tokens
assign(x1=remove_common_words(x, s)) # You cant use any overlapping words from the story
reward(xed(s | x1))
